abstract: The computing continuum combines computational resources and services from edge to cloud, promising enhanced efficiency and resilience with respect to the traditional siloed based approach. This study presents the REAR (Resource Advertisement and Reservation) protocol, which tackles the complexities of managing resources within this continuum. REAR establishes standardized interfaces to enable interoperability, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and maintains security measures for workload execution. The paper details the protocolâ€™s design, key components, operational workflows, and potential uses, contributing to the optimization of resource use across the computing continuum.
